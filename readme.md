# What is this

This is some code I've written while experimenting with compression, specifically in pursuit of the Hutter Prize. In this repo I have the source for my implementations of

* Huffman coding
* LZ77 compression algorithm (as described in their paper)
* Arithmetic coding
* Char-based LSTM
